# M1BO-Hello-You

On github edits are easier, why are we forced to use commit? Eh, doesn't matter.
Story is laid out in word, first part of the TBA is already written in Python, initial code for that following soon.

Commit change 1: Added first part of the story via Python, code tested and working with a minor hickup in the game. Can't figure out how to fix it but instructions on bypassing the bug has been implemented.

Commit change 2: Completed the first part and bypassing bug seems to work reliably, still haven't found a true fix but it works so who cares. Very first draft for second part is also created.
