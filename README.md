# M1BO-Hello-You

On github edits are easier, why are we forced to use commit? Eh, doesn't matter.
Story is laid out in word, first part of the TBA is already written in Python, initial code for that following soon.

Commit change 1: Added first part of the story via Python, code tested and working with a minor hickup in the game. Can't figure out how to fix it but instructions on bypassing the bug has been implemented.
