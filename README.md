# M1BO-Hello-You

On github edits are easier, why are we forced to use commit? Eh, doesn't matter.
Story is laid out in word, first part of the TBA is already written in Python, initial code for that following soon.
- What I mean is that I find cmd prompt painfully useless to use when you can just upload and all that stuff via the site. But I guess it's more ordered?

Commit change 1: Added first part of the story via Python, code tested and working with a minor hickup in the game. Can't figure out how to fix it but instructions on bypassing the bug has been implemented.

Commit change 2: Completed the first part and bypassing bug seems to work reliably, still haven't found a true fix but it works so who cares. Very first draft for second part is also created.

Commit change 3: Demo of the textbased application is completed. There's still much work to do but at least this SHOULD be able to be graded. It has the endings and paths it needs as far as I know. Commit 4 will be the addition of the verhaal.pdf and flowchart.pdf

Commit change 4: Spelling check in the .py file. And as promised, verhaal.pdf and flowchart.pdf have been added!

Commit change 5: Screwed up a copy-paste ascii thing in the readme. Oops!

Commit change 6: Just wanted to clarify something I said about github.
